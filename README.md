# Powerline Game JS

_Javascript clone of the android game powerline:

I used to play the 
[original Android game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nebulabytes.powerflow)
a lot and wondered how this was implemented. So I simply tried by myself and implemented it in JavaScript.

In particular I concentrated on the following aspects:

-   How can I store the levels efficiently?
-   How can I render the tiles without images?
-   How can I determine if all tiles are powered?

All in all this is only a proof of concept. It is not feature complete nor very beautiful.
